# ATHLETE-KEEP-HYFRATED

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **athlete-keep-hydrated** my FIRST UX project! The mission of this initiative is to enhance the hydration experience for athletes while running. This project encourages innovative thinking and aims to find a non-digital solution to this challenge.

## Objectives

- Conduct user interviews to gather insights on athletes' hydration habits and challenges.
- Identify key insights and key figures from the interviews and relevant literature.
- Create user personas and user journey maps based on collected data.
- Develop problem statements and ideate potential solutions for enhancing hydration experiences.

## General Recommendations

- **Get Out of the Box**: Explore design trends and document your findings.
- **Trust the Design Process**: Embrace failures as a part of the learning process.
- **Make Connections**: Network with designers and professionals in the field.

## Deliverables

1. **Insights Document**: A PDF containing insights gathered from user interviews.
2. **Analytics Document**: A PDF summarizing key figures or insights from relevant articles.
3. **User Persona**: A PDF document detailing a user persona created from interview data.
4. **User Journey**: A Figma file mapping the user journey of the persona.
5. **Problem Statement**: A PDF summarizing the main problem faced by the persona.
6. **Ideation Summary**: A zip file containing photos of the ideation session and a board with ideas.
7. **Prototyping Storyboard**: Pictures of a storyboard illustrating the proposed solution.

## Instructions

1. **Interviews**: Carefully read the provided interview scripts and extract insights:
